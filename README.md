The repository for the ultimate-huskies website.

# Git Flow
We use [git flow](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/) right from the beginning, to keep the repo clean and structured.
So we will work on develop branch and for every feature we work on a own feature branch. 
For easy working install [git flow](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/) on your machine or use something like [sourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).
And live code is used and tagged from the master branch!

# Installation
coming soon...
